This game was built using the [piston_window](https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/piston_window) window wrapper.

## Download the game
I use arch linux and endeavourOS. I have no idea what im doing, good luck!

```bash
# run the game
cargo run

# build a binary & execute it
cargo build --release
./target/release/rsnake
```

## Keymap
- **W/A/S/D** or **Up/Left/Down/Right** - Controll snake direction.
- **R** - Restart the game.
- **M** - Mute Snake Jazz.

This project is supposed to help me learn how to run code in parallel instead of sequence. I am trying to learn these concepts
using this snake game because one of the issues in the beginning was snake lag.
